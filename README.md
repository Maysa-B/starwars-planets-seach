## StarWars Planets Search

Project developed at the end of block 17, in which I studied about _Context API and React Hooks_.

### How it works
The most important features of this project are:
1. The user can filter by the planet's name.
2. Is possible to choose a column and decide if they want only the numbers above, under, or equal a reference.
3. The user can choose how to order the table, increasing or decreasing, and according to a column of the table.
4. I produced tests that cover 100% of the application.

> In this project I focused more on the execution than the styling. So, I decided to try **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** to learn a new tool. I was able to make a basic stylization with it and progress my abilities.
